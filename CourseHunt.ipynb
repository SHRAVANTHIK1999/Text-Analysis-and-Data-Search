            " National Research University Higher School of Economics Advanced 4.9 https://www.coursera.org/learn/industrial-organization Industrial Organization is the area of economics that studies the markets as institutions, the state of competition and strategic interaction among firms, the industrial policy and the business decisions firms make within the market framework. The course looks at the markets from three different perspectives: the economic theory, the applied business perspective and the institutional and legal perspective. The focus of the course is split equally between the economic theory and business perspective but there is a significant legal component incorporated in various topics. The course includes economic modeling, game theory, numerous real life examples and several case studies. We explore interesting topics of market organization such as negotiations, antitrust, networks, platforms, electronic markets, intellectual property, business strategies, predation, entry deterrence and many others.  The basic objective of the course is to enable the student to understand the structure of markets and the nature of strategic competition. Knowledge in this course will be valuable for the students in acquiring managing and governance skills, enriching their understanding of the institutional framework of business, and improve their analytical ability in negotiations.   Prerequisites: The course requires understanding of basic economic modeling, knowledge of intermediate microeconomics (especially production/cost theory), knowledge of basic concepts and methodologies of game theory, intermediate econometrics and basic calculus.

Antitrust law is designed to promote competition and prevent anticompetitive behavior that can harm consumers and stifle innovation.

            "In antitrust investigations, economics is used to evaluate the potential competitive effects of a merger or acquisition, to determine whether the transaction would reduce competition, increase market power, or otherwise harm consumers. Economics is also used to evaluate the requirements for obtaining regulatory approval, including the potential for remedies, and to provide advice on the development of competitive strategies.\n",
